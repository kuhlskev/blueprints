!!! MACRO name naas_flow_export_for_stealthwatch
!!! Platform: Cat3850, Cat2960X, Cat4500 OS:
!!! Preconditions:
!!! Desc: The Network as a Sensor solution utilizes Netflow v9 (Flexible NetFlow) in order to export metadata about the flows traversing the network to a product called Stealthwatch. Using this metadata, Stealtchwatch can detech annomilies on your network and catch attacks as they are occuring. This is utilized for the incoming direction.
!!! Usage: clean
!!! Tags: stealthwatch, naas, flow, fnf, netflow, security
!!! Vars: Only use "_" special characters in variable names
!!! $stealtchwatch_ipv4_address: ; The IPv4 address of the Stealthwatch server that the Netflow is being exported to.
