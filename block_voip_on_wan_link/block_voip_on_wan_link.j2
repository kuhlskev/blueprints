!!! MACRO name block_voip_on_wan_link
!!! Platform: ISR2951, ISR2921, ISR2911, ISR3925, ISR3945, OS:
!!! Preconditions:
!!! Desc: In some cases, an administrator may want to force IP phones into SRST mode when a failover to a backup WAN link occurs. Implementing this blocking avoids transmitting voice over a lossy link, and it decreases the cost of a failure by reducing data usage while maintaining the dial tone that end-users expect. This configuration can be applied to the backup router of a dual router design or to the secondary link of a single router design. This configuration can also be used on any WAN interface when centralized voice registrations are not wanted at a particular remote site.
!!! Usage: clean
!!! Tags: voice, cucm, voip, sip, sccp, acl
!!! Vars: Only use "_" special characters in variable names
!!! $interface_to_block: ; WAN interface to which the administrator wishes to block voice traffic.
