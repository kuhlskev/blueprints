Desc: In some cases, an administrator may want to force IP phones into SRST mode when a failover to a backup WAN link occurs. Implementing this blocking avoids transmitting voice over a lossy link, and it decreases the cost of a failure by reducing data usage while maintaining the dial tone that end-users expect. This configuration can be applied to the backup router of a dual router design or to the secondary link of a single router design. This configuration can also be used on any WAN interface when centralized voice registrations are not wanted at a particular remote site. !! Usage: clean !! Tags: voice, cucm, voip, sip, sccp, acl !! Vars: Only use &quot;_&quot; special characters in variable names !! $interface_to_block: ; WAN interface to which the administrator wishes to block voice traffic.">
