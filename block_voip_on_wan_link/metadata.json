Implementing this blocking avoids transmitting voice over a lossy link, and it decreases the cost of a failure by reducing data usage while maintaining the dial tone that end-users expect. This configuration can be applied to the backup router of a dual router design or to the secondary link of a single router design. This configuration can also be used on any WAN interface when centralized voice registrations are not wanted at a particular remote site."}
